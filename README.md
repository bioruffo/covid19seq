# covid19seq  
Filter and align SARS-CoV-2 data from NCBI and Gisaid.  
Gisaid data is not included in the repo due to restrictions. Please request access at https://www.gisaid.org/  
Output is also not included due to the same restrictions.  


Work in progress. Check [commandline.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioruffo/covid19seq/master/commandline.sh) for the pipeline, and [resources.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioruffo/covid19seq/master/resources.html) for a few resource links.
